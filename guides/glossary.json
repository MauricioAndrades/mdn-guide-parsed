DDoS concerns computer networks and CPU resource management.In a typical DDoS attack, the assailant begins by exploiting a vulnerability in one computer system and making it the DDoS master. The attack master, also known as the botmaster, identifies and infects other vulnerable systems with malware. Eventually, the assailant instructs the controlled machines to launch an attack against a specified target. There are two types of DDoS attacks: a network-centric attack (which overloads a service by using up bandwidth) and an application-layer attack (which overloads a service or database with application calls). The overflow of data to the target causes saturation in the target machine so that it cannot respond or responds very slowly to legitimate traffic (hence the name \"denial of service\"). The infected computers' owners normally don't know that their computers have been compromised, and they also suffer loss of service.A computer under an intruder's control is called a zombie or bot. A network of co-infected computers is known as a botnet or a zombie army.

    "name": "High-level programming language",
    "desc": "A high-level programming language has a significant abstraction from the details of computer operation. It is designed to be easily understood by humans and for this reason they must be translated by another software. Unlike low-level programming languages, it may use natural language elements, or may automate (or even entirely hide) significant areas of computing systems, making the process of developing simpler and more understandable relative to a lower-level language. The amount of abstraction provided defines how \"high-level\" a programming language is.The idea of a language automatically translatable into machine code, but nearer to human logic, was introduced in computer science in the 1950s, especially thanks to the work of John Backus (IBM), to whom it owes the first high-level language to have been widely circulated: Fortran. For this innovation Bakus received the Turing prize.\n In the 1960s, high-level programming languages using a compiler were commonly called autocodes; examples are COBOL and Fortran. The first high-level programming language designed for computers was Plankalkül, created by Konrad Zuse. It was not implemented in his time, and his original contributions were, due to World War II, largely isolated from other developments, although it influenced Heinz Rutishauser's language Superplan (and to some degree also Algol).\n The first really widespread high-level language was Fortran, a machine independent development of IBM's earlier Autocode systems. Algol, that was defined in 1958 by European and American committees of computer scientists, introduced recursion as well as nested functions under lexical scope - it was also the first language with a clear distinction between value and name-parameters and their corresponding semantics. Algol also introduced several structured programming concepts, such as the while-do and if-then-else constructs and its syntax was the first to be described by a formal method, Backus–Naur Form (BNF). During roughly the same period Cobol introduced records (also called structs) and Lisp introduced a fully general lambda abstraction in a programming language for the first time.",

Thanks to WHATWG, work on HTML5 continued: the two organizations released the first draft in 2008 and the final standard in 2014.An HTML document is a plaintext document structured with elements.

In CSS they can be represented as a single 24-bit integer in hexadecimal notation (for example, #add8e6 is light blue), or in functional notation as three separate 8-bit integers (for example, rgb(46, 139, 87) is sea green). In OpenGL, WebGL, and GLSL the red-green-blue components are fractions (floating-point numbers between  0.0  and 1.0), although in the actual color buffer they are typically stored as 8-bit integers. Graphically, a color can be represented as a point in a three-dimensional grid or cube, where each dimension (or axis) corresponds to a different channel.",
